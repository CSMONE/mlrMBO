# Installation

The package has not been released on CRAN yet. Run the following command in R to install the current GitHub version. 

To install packages directly from github use the `install_github()` function from `devtools`.

install.packages("devtools")
```

Before you can install `mlrMBO` you need the current github versions of both [mlr](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr/) and [ParamHelpers](https://github.com/berndbischl/ParamHelpers).

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("berndbischl/ParamHelpers")
install_github("mlr-org/mlr")
```

Then you can easily install.  

```r
install_github("mlr-org/mlrMBO")
```

Ã€ll other dependencies will be installed automatically from CRAN.
