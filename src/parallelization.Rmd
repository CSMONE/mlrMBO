# Parallelization

It is possible to parallelize the evaluation of the target function to speed up the computation. Internally the
evaluation of the target function is realized with the R package parallelMap. This package offers a parallel version
of the ```lapply``` function and offers a lot of modes. We cannot review all of them here. The [parallelMap github page](https://github.com/berndbischl/parallelMap#parallelmap) offers a nice tutorial, describes all modes thorougly and
informs you about the available options. Here we just provide a simple example on how to take advantage of multiple cores on a single machine.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("mlrMBO")
library("parallelMap")

obj.fun = makeSphereFunction(1)
learner = makeLearner("regr.km", predict.type = "se", covtype = "matern3_2")
control = makeMBOControl()
control = setMBOControlTermination(control, iters = 3)
design = generateDesign(n = 6, par.set = smoof::getParamSet(obj.fun))

parallelStartMulticore(cpus = 2) # use 2 CPUs
res = mbo(obj.fun, par.set, learner = learner, control = control)
parallelStop()
```
